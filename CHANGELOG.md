# Changelog

Fastsync follows a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versioning scheme.

 * The `MAJOR` version is purely cosmetic.
 * The `MINOR` version will be bumped for new features.
 * The `PATCH` version will be bumped for bugfixes.

Changes with compatibility impact will be marked as such in the changelog.
There is no compatibility guarantee of the wire protocol between different
versions, even if they differ only in `PATCH`.
